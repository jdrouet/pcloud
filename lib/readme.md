# pCloud API Client Library

[![tests](https://github.com/jdrouet/pcloud/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jdrouet/pcloud/actions/workflows/testing.yml)

This library provides a client for interacting with the pCloud API, implementing the [HTTP Json protocol](https://docs.pcloud.com/protocols/http_json_protocol/).
It offers a set of tools and utilities to facilitate operations with files, folders, and streaming services on pCloud.

## Features

- **File Management**: Upload, download, and manage files in your pCloud account.
- **Folder Management**: Create, rename, move, and delete folders.
- **Streaming**: Stream audio and video content, with customizable parameters like bit rate and resolution.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and response parsing from the pCloud API.
- **Flexible Request Building**: Customize API requests with various parameters such as content type, speed limits, and more.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the library to interact with the pCloud API:

```rust
use pcloud::{Client, Credentials, Region};
use pcloud::file::FileIdentifier;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::builder()
        .with_credentials(Credentials::access_token("token"))
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    // Get file link with file id
    match client.get_file_link(12345).await {
        Ok(link) => println!("File link: {}", link.first_link().unwrap()),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }

    // Get file link with file path
    match client.get_file_link("/path/to/file.txt").await {
        Ok(link) => println!("File link: {}", link.first_link().unwrap()),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

The library provides comprehensive error handling. Errors from the API are returned as custom `Error` types, which can be easily matched and handled in your application. All errors implement the `Debug` and `Display` traits for easy logging and display.
