# pCloud API Workspace

This repository contains three projects within a single workspace, designed to interact with the pCloud API:

1. [**`lib`**](./lib): A Rust library for interacting with the pCloud API using HTTP JSON protocol.
2. [**`cli`**](./cli): A command-line interface (CLI) tool built on top of the `lib`, providing convenient access to pCloud operations from the terminal.
3. [**`http-server`**](./http-server): A web server that wraps the `lib` to expose pCloud API functionality via HTTP endpoints, making it easy to integrate with web applications.
